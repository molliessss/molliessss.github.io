## What is JavaScript? 
... JavaScript is used to add graphics or interactive pieces to your website, compared to HTML, which is used to create the foundations of a website. For example, JavaScript can edit  pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming). For example, we take the string "Player 1: " and join it to the name variable to create the complete text label, e.g. "Player 1: Chris". JavaScript can also be used to run code in response to certain events occurring on a web page.
