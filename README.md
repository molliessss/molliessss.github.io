## What is JavaScript? 
... HTML- JavaScript is used for adding graphics or interactive pieces to your website, compared to Html which is used to create the website itself. For example, JavaScript can store useful values inside variables. It can edit  pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming). For example, we take the string "Player 1: " and join it to the name variable to create the complete text label, e.g. "Player 1: Chris". JavaScript can also be used to rn code in response to certain events occurring on a web page.
